    <p> <a href="https://time.com/6265266/america-college-degrees-essay/">College degrees</a> have come to be a point of contention for people who either think they are hurting or helping entry-level workers. As a benchmark to most jobs in industries like business and media to education and social work, Bachelor’s degrees are becoming more common today.</p>

	<p> For many, going to college at 18 years old is a right of passage. For some, a Bachelor’s degree has become the norm that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210126-degree-inflation-how-the-four-year-degree-became-required">“degree inflation”</a> has barred them from pursuing a career they may already have the skills for.</p>

  <p><a href="https://edtrust.org/the-state-of-higher-education-equity/">The Education Trust</a>, a project that puts together guides for lawmakers to “incorporate an explicit and targeted focus on opportunities and outcomes for students of color” measured that Black and Latinx student representation varies by state, and that each state should reduce race-based inequities.</p>

  <p> Equity in education is important because regardless of where a student comes from, whether that be from generational wealth or marginalized communities, they have the right to excel and advance their education to increase their quality of life.</p>

<p> Higher levels of educational attainment cause stability, an <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/51/2/413/169428/Cumulative-Childhood-Adversity-Educational">article</a> by Jennifer Karas Montez finds, as higher levels of education had bigger impacts on students with disadvantaged childhoods’ health and life expectancy, in comparison with adults who had advantaged childhoods.</p>
    
<p> The discussion around degree equity around the world has come to a head in the US. Before the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/06/supreme-court-affirmative-action-ruling-corporate-hiring.html">affirmative action ruling</a> by the Supreme Court, students were protected and offered more opportunities for scholarship and aid.</p>

<p> If jobs are requiring Bachelor’s or higher degrees, but students of color are not obtaining these degrees at the same rates as White students, then they will be less represented in jobs these jobs. </p>

<p> Now, diverse hiring practices are more important than ever because of the reversal of affirmative action and the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704649/qa-why-does-google-care-so-much-about-hiring-diverse-ai-teams.html">future of hiring</a>: AI. </p>


<p> Educational attainment in the US for young people has grown in recent years, on trend for the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2023/02/01/updated-educational-attainment-data-show-progress-and-gaps">“Stronger Nation”</a> project which aims to have 60% of working-age adults to hold degrees. </p>

  <p> The <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html">current educational attainment trends</a> show that 53,045,000 people in the US have their Bachelor’s degree, while 85,218,000 people have their Bachelor’s degree or above, which includes Master’s, professional, and Doctorate degrees. How do these statistics compare to ten or twenty years ago?
  </p>

  <p>In <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2012/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html">2012</a>, 51,649,000 had their Bachelor’s or higher degree, which is 33 million less than 2022. In <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html">2002</a>, 16,519,000 people had their Bachelor’s or higher degree, which is 68 million less than 2022 and 36 million less than 2012.</p>

 <p>These rising trends show that Bachelor’s degrees are becoming more common for all people because of policies like affirmative action that affect marginalized groups.</p>

 <p>Obtaining a Bachelor’s or higher degree such as a Master’s or Doctorate may not be necessary for entry-level positions in the workplace, so how many young people still get them anyway?</p>


<iframe title="Bachelor's or higher degrees for young people (25 to 34 years old)" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5Xiea" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5Xiea/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

 <p>In 2012, this number was the highest for Master’s degrees among young people ages 25 to 34, with 6.18 million versus 2022’s 4.37 million.</p>

<p>There seems to be no problem for young people to obtain Master’s degrees, with <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/start-planning-for-4-1-masters-program-admissions-in-high-school">accelerated degrees</a> becoming more common today. However, for minorities and particularly women in higher education, the numbers show a stark difference between how many are represented in the total number of Bachelor’s or higher degrees.</p>

<iframe title="Bachelor's or higher degrees for females of all ages" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-eVLJz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eVLJz/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="258" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

 <p>For women in higher education, the total difference in both 2012 and 2022 is under 18,000, while in 2002, the difference was less than 2,000. Why has the gap grown bigger throughout the century thus far?</p>

 <p>One reason could be that women face <a href="https://diginomica.com/encouraging-women-stem-early-years-to-workplace">gender bias</a> and represent only 28% of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) workforce. </p>

</script>

<p> The difference of all women obtaining all Bachelor’s or higher degrees in the twenty-first century is 25 million in 2002, 30 million in 2012 and 39 million in 2022. </p>

<p> Women face gender discrimination in college and are less likely to go into fields like STEM because of gender bias and harmful stereotypes that may begin as early as in elementary school. </p>

<p> Women also make less money than men after graduating, even with Bachelor’s or higher degrees, with the <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/women-in-higher-education-facts-statistics/#:~:text=Women outnumber men 1.4 to,men and have higher balances.&text=Women college students face unique,rates of mental health diagnoses.">gender pay gap</a> 25 cents lower for women than men in 2020.</p>


<p>Diversity in STEM is also far behind other fields, especially for Hispanic adults who make up only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/04/01/stem-jobs-see-uneven-progress-in-increasing-gender-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/">8% of the STEM workforce.</a></p>

<p> Overall, the educational attainment levels for all people have been rising, but within marginalized people, these gaps have been widening. There are many ways that higher education institutions can close these gaps in the US, and the importance is more apparent than ever in the aftermath of affirmative action in education.<p>
